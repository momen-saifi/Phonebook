# Java Phonebook with SQL

This Java project is a simple phonebook application that allows users to manage their contacts using a SQL database. Users can create, edit, delete, and view contacts through a command-line interface.

## Features

- **Create Contact**: Add a new contact by providing a name and phone number.
- **Edit Contact**: Modify the name and phone number of an existing contact.
- **Delete Contact**: Remove a contact from the phonebook.
- **View All Contacts**: Display a list of all saved contacts.
- **Exit**: Terminate the application.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Apache Maven (for building and managing dependencies)
- MySQL or any SQL-compatible database

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/momen-saifi/java-phonebook-sql.git
    ```

2. Import the project into your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

3. Set up your SQL database. Modify the `DBConnect.java` file in the `com.conn` package to configure the database connection properties.

4. Compile and run the `mainClass.java` file in the `com.main` package. This will start the phonebook application.

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the phonebook.
